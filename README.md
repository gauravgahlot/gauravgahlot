## Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gaurav Gahlot, and I love building things that make developers' lives
easier ðŸ’™ .

I'm currently working at Acquia as a Senior Software Engineer. Here are a few
tags that say a lot about my work and interests:

- Go
- Kubernetes
- Open Source
- Rust
- WebAssembly
- IoT & Edge

I'm a maintainer of CNCF's [Akri](https://github.com/project-akri/akri) project,
and prior to that, I was a maintainer of CNCF's
[Tinkerbell](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink) project. In addition, I have
contributed to other Open Source projects, including
[fission](https://github.com/fission/fission),
[falcosidekick](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick),
[grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go), and
[testcontainers-go](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go).

Outside of work, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with the community.
I publish blogs and videos on various topics related to Kubernetes, Open Source,
and Cloud-Native technologies, as well as programming languages like Go, and Rust.

I've also spoken at a number of conferences and meetups. You can find my
talks on my website at [gauravgahlot.in/talks](https://gauravgahlot.in/talks/).
